# This package is built with go-mod as well as with make.
#
# The go-mod build is done in the ${B} directory but is not sufficient for
# packaging, as the package contains additional data files, manual pages and
# systemd units. The make build is done inside the ${B}/make-build
# sub-directory and is similar to what upstream CI is testing.
#
# The way go-mod prepares the build tree in go_do_configure clobbers ${B}/ and
# replaces it with a symbolic link. The make build is done in _append functions
# to see the final file system structure.
#
# To avoid compiling the code twice a trick is employed. We know go-mod.bbclass
# has already compiled the project and has stashed the binary into
# ${B}/${GO_BUILD_BINDIR}. In do_compile_append() we move those binaries over
# to where the project makefile would have built them. In addition we pass
# Go.Cmd=/bin/false to make sure that make does not attempt to compile anything
# successfully for the second time.
