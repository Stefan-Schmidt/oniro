# Oniro Project

Welcome to the Oniro\* Project main git reposiotory! Oniro is an Eclipse
Foundation project focused on the development of a distributed open source
operating system for consumer devices.

The aim of this repository is to define the build workspace, provide build
metadata and build documentation for the project. It also behaves as the main
entry point for the code while aggregating most of the other components
developed by the team.

Learn more about Oniro Project on the main [website](https://oniroproject.org/)
