# How to use this job in your pipeline:
#
# 1) Make sure the git repository is REUSE compliant by using the `reuse lint`
#    command. The reuse tool is available in the ppa:zyga/oh-tools Ubuntu archive
#    or can be installed manually on other distributions.
# 2) Create a .gitlab-ci.yml file or configure the repository to use another
#    path. Some repositories use .oniro-ci/gitlab-ci.yml instead, to avoid
#    clashing with third-party CI pipelines that may be present in the same
#    repository.
# 3) Copy the text indicated below and make sure to adjust the pipeline stages
#    that are present in your repository to take into account all the jobs
#    that participate in the pipeline.
